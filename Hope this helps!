var questions = [
    // each question will be represented by an object
    {

]

// for each question in your questions array:
for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
    // create a questionWrapper div that will wrap around each question and its corresponding
    // answer... this questionWrapper div will also have the 'data-correct-answer' attribute
    // that will contain the (hidden) answer so you can compare the user's chosen answer to it
    var questionWrapper = $("<div class='questionWrapper'>");

    // "hiding" the correct answer on the questionWrapper for later retrieval
    questionWrapper.attr("data-correct-answer", questions[i].correctAnswer);

    // creating a paragraph to contain the question text
    var question = $("<p>").text(questions[i].question);

    // creating an unordered list to hold all the answers
    var answers = $("<ol>");
    // ACTION ITEM: write code to loop through questions[i].answers array... for each answer 
    // in that array, create a <li class='answer'> and set the text as the current answer, then 
    // append that new li to the answers ol above... also store the current answer
    // as a 'data-correct-answer' attribute.

    // after the HTML for both the question and the answers are built out, append both to
    // the questionWrapper div
    questionWrapper.append(question, answers);

    // then append the questionWrapper to the page!
    $("#maindivnamehere").append(questionWrapper);
}

// OTHER ACTION ITEMS:

// 1) look into jQuery's .parents() method coupling with .attr() to help you grab the 
// 'data-correct-answer' attribute from the questionWrapper div!

// 2) when the user submits their quiz/answers all questions, compare the correct 
// answer to the selected answer to figure out if they got that question right!
